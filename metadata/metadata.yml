name: Quantifying Asymmetries in Flood Area and Population Exposure Between Sea Level
  Fingerprints of Mass Loss from the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets
description: Code and data associated with the manuscript by the same name. This analysis
  investigates differential flooding-related impacts from melting of the Antarctic
  and Greenland Ice Sheets. It investigates magnitude of population and land area
  flooded by each source, along with an assessment of the associated costs, based
  on the pyCIAM model (Depsky et al., 2023).
